Release overview
################

Here is an release overview to give you some insights what has changed.

We create a section for every release that contains

- Changes,
- Fixed issues, and 
- Developer information (breaking changes, new APIs, renamed functions).

The "Developer information" is mainly for developers or 3rd parties who develop for Znuny. Here will you find (hopefully all the notable changes).

For any missing information, please create an issue at `GitHub <https://github.com/znuny/manual/issues>`_.
